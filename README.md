Below is a prioritized instructions list of end‑to‑end test scenarios for UAT which runs in a staging environment (non-permanent data).  Each tester should spend ~30–45 minutes working through core flows (Steps 1–4), then—time permitting—move on to guest accounts and QR‑code manipulation (Steps 5–8).

## ShopperTrail Quick Overview

ShopperTrail is a data platform for local brick-and-mortar retail businesses. Store customers provide feedback as to why they walked out without buying an item (i.e. wrong size/brand), OR if an item was purchased, feedback as to how satisfied they were.  

There is no purchase necessary. In exchange for this feedback (or "Trail Drops"), users are granted points that can be spent in *any* ShopperTrail partner store on discounts/rewards.  

Stores using ShopperTrail obtain on-demand direct *private* feedback from customers. Providing critical insights from shoppers in-store which can be used for merchandising and inventory management decisions.
